Building a Sentiment Classifier for Twitter Data Analysis

This project involves creating a sentiment classifier using synthetic Twitter data provided in `project_twitter_data.csv`, which includes tweet text, retweet count, and reply count. Positive and negative words are separately listed in `positive_words.txt` and `negative_words.txt`. The classifier calculates a positive and negative score for each tweet by counting occurrences of words from these lists, then calculates a net score by subtracting the negative score from the positive. To start, a `strip_punctuation` function removes punctuation from tweets, while `get_pos` and `get_neg` functions determine positive and negative word counts. The results, including retweet and reply counts, positive score, negative score, and net score, are saved in a new CSV file, `resulting_data.csv`. Finally, the CSV file is used to create a graph in Excel or Google Sheets, showing Net Score versus Number of Retweets.
